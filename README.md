# Monty-Hall-problem
Used python to show generalized monty hall problem for 'n' doors
Redult in as expected: You should always switch
In case of n > 3, switch to any different door. The probability of winning on any other door than yours is higher
This is shown in the python implementation

P(not switching) = 1/n
P(switching) = (n-1)/((n)(n-2))
therefore P(switching) > P(not switching)

These numbers are also 'almost' confirmed in the python implementation
